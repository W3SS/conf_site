Schedule Creation
=================

This documentation is incomplete.

Creating a Schedule object
--------------------------

The first part of the schedule that needs to be created is the `Schedule`
object.

  - One `Schedule` should be created per session. For an example of this, see
    the `London 2016 schedule`_ (which consists of one day of tutorial sessions,
    and two days of general sessions).
  - The "Published" checkbox should be unchecked. Otherwise, the schedule
    will appear to be the public while it is being created.
  - Make sure that the dates in this object correspond with the dates of the
    schedule.
  - For readability, the names of `slot kinds` should not correspond to room
    names. If a presentation does not appear in a slot on the schedule, the
    name of the slot kind will appear by default.
